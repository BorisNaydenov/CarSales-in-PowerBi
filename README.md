# CarSales-in-PowerBi
You can view my Dashboard and the dataset is in the repository.

The tasks I performed in general are: 

Data pre-processing (cleansing, transformation) → Loading data into PowerBI → Creating data model (i.e. connecting tables)  → Preparing separate visualisations, adding new fields/parameters/columns to the existing model if needed.  

From a business/roles point of view:

From a management point of view, it is important to have a quick overview of the results.   
This report gives a clear overview of sales by customer, country, car brands and costs.  
From a data analyst's point of view, insights or recommendations can highlighted further. Communication is key.  

Data teams do not make goals or strategies alone. And it is often up to management to make decisions.  

Data teams should ensure data integrity and follow principles of data ethics.   
Data is a key to ensuring enhanced decision-making.  

A manager should wear their white hat responsibly and make sure to put on all other hats too.
