# CarSales-in-PowerBi
You can view my Dashboard and the dataset is in the repository.

The tasks I performed in general are: Data pre-processing (cleansing, transformation) → Loading data into PowerBI →   
Creating data model (i.e. connecting tables)  → Preparing separate visualisations, adding new fields/parameters/columns. 

About Business:  

_From a management point of view:_
It is important to have a quick overview of the results.   
This report gives a clear overview of sales by customer, country, car brands and costs.  
It focuses on sales trends, weak spots as well as A-spots.

To make the right decisions, a properly balanced balanced scorecard is needed.  
(I am working on dashboards that will focus more on that)

  
_From a data analyst's point of view:_    **Communication is key.**  
Insights or recommendations should be highlighted and target audience should be always in mind.    

  
 

Data teams should ensure data integrity and follow principles of data ethics.   
Data is a key for enhanced decision-making.  

A manager should wear their white data-hat responsibly and ensure wearing all other hats too.
